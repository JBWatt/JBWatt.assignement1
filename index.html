<h2><strong>Personal Information</strong></h2>
<p>Name: Jack Watt</p>
<p>Student Number: S</p>
<p>Email: s</p>
<p>I was born in Brisbane in 1989, My nationality is Australian of German, Scottish and Norwegian antecedence. I am a native English speaker. I grew up playing rugby league, tennis and basketball. To this day, I am still a massive rugby league fan. My team is the Brisbane Broncos and I watch every game, either live or on television. I also love Tattoos and I have quite a lot of work done myself with over 1/3 of my body tattooed. I also enjoy playing videogames, my favourite game is Counter Strike. I have played that game for over 20 years on and off through various iterations (1.6, Source and Global Offensive). I have a pet dog named Rex. He is a 13-month-old American Staffordshire Terrier who destroys everything in my house including shoes, couches and TV remotes. Part of the reason I commenced studies is due to losing my right index finger in an industrial accident.</p>
<h2><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h2>
<p>The base interest I have in Information Technologies is that I have always been fascinated with videogames and more broadly computers. I chose to study at RMIT because it&rsquo;s a prestigious and international recognised university. Online study is also a more convenient method of tuition because of my circumstances. My motivation in learning about information technology is primarily vocational. IT is the wave of the future and as technology develops the need for IT professionals will only increase. My thought process has been to come to RMIT to learn and develop my skills to change my career path and maximise my opportunities within this growing industry.</p>
<h2><strong>Ideal Job</strong></h2>
<h4><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39892189?searchrequesttoken=8a4c1b59-58ab-4155-b40b-7b995a7a5cff&amp;type=standout">https://www.seek.com.au/job/39892189?searchrequesttoken=8a4c1b59-58ab-4155-b40b-7b995a7a5cff&amp;type=standout</a></h4>
<p>Cyber security analysts design and implement security procedures and policies to safeguard a company&rsquo;s computer networks and systems. They screen their employer&rsquo;s networks for any breaches in security. Software and encryption is installed to protect against breaches or vulnerabilities. They also research developing IT trends and train the wider business on security matters. The analyst may even simulate a security attack to test the protocols and tailor the responses and remedies.</p>
<p>This Career appeals to me because of potential for growth not just within the industry but my personal development. The forensic aspects of a position such as this are exciting. I am under no illusions that I will be able to walk into a career such as this even after the completion of this degree although I am hoping that I may build towards it.</p>
<p>I currently possess no relevant skills or training required for this position other than a basic level of computer knowledge and some character attributes that generally appeal to potential employers (hard work, attention to detail, dedication and commitment).</p>
<p>To undertake a potential career as a cyber security analyst you need to have as per the advertisement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Demonstrated experience in security operations or technical analytics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to work in complex operational environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding of Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and Information Security Manual (ISM)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently I don&rsquo;t have any tangible well thought out ideas on how to best obtain a job like this other than completing this degree and familiarizing myself with Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and Information Security Manual (ISM). I consider myself to be taking my first baby steps on this journey into the world of IT. Hopefully through my studies at RMIT I can develop more of a concrete idea and plan to work in this field.</p>

<h2 lang="en-AU">Project Idea</h2>
<p lang="en-AU">&ldquo;Histrionis&rdquo; is Latin for &ldquo;actor&rdquo;. Histrionis involves a large number of animated scenes eg &ldquo;A police Interview&rdquo;, a &ldquo;wartime foxhole conversation between soldiers&rdquo; or a &ldquo;court room cross examination&rdquo; etc. The game may be played on your own or online with friends, family and even strangers. The game involves a number of templates of conversation. The player is first asked to answer a number of innocuous questions relating to the scene and story. The answers from the player&rsquo;s responses randomly and automatically generate within the dialogue of the computer animated characters and comedy ensues. A sample scene might be something along the lines of:</p>
<p lang="en-AU">Computer: &ldquo;what was the name of your first pet&rdquo;</p>
<p lang="en-AU">Player: &ldquo;Bubbles&rdquo;</p>
<p lang="en-AU">Computer: &ldquo;Name your favourite movie quote&rdquo;</p>
<p lang="en-AU">Player: &ldquo;Your going to need a bigger boat.&rdquo; </p>
<p lang="en-AU">Computer: &ldquo;provide a number&rdquo;</p>
<p lang="en-AU">Player: &ldquo;4333&rdquo;</p>
<p lang="en-AU">Computer: Name a body part.&rdquo;</p>
<p lang="en-AU">Player: &ldquo;Eyelash&rdquo;</p>
<p lang="en-AU">After these variables and perhaps a dozen more, A random Prison yard scene is generated. Where prisoners are mingling amongst each other.</p>
<p lang="en-AU">Prisoner 1: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name buddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p lang="en-AU">Prisoner 2: &ldquo;They call me Bubbles and I&rsquo;m the boss on this block&rdquo;</p>
<p lang="en-AU">Prisoner 1: &ldquo;Were going to need a bigger boat&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;What are you in for?&rdquo;</p>
<p lang="en-AU">Prisoner 2: &ldquo;Bank robbery! I robbed four thousand three-hundred and thirty-three of them. I had my eyelash shot off in a shoot-out with the pigs on the last one, that&rsquo;s how they nabbed me&rdquo;</p>
<p lang="en-AU">It can be seen here that there are many comic permutations that are available. I envision that a high-quality animated scene would be unnecessary because of comedic conations that go along with having a less stylized product. The dialogue itself would be easily assembled through inspiration from thousands of movies that dealt with common cinematic troupes. </p>
<p><strong>Motivation </strong></p>
<p>There is no restriction on the market for this product. It should appeal equally to the old, young, men, women of any ethnicity or cultural background. The comedy plays to the hackneyed characteristics of B-grade movies, everyone should by familiar of this phenomena. It may be trivial but most entertainment products and viral popular culture sensations usually are. It is anticipated that this game will be used at parties our family events for some light hearted entertainment.</p>
<p lang="en-AU"><br /> </p>
<p><strong>Tools and Technologies </strong></p>
<p>As of this moment, Histrionis could be launched on IOS or android in the form of and application or as a standalone game. Obviously, an important marketing technique would be the ability to share scenes that you and your friends have created over social media (Facebook, twitter, Instagram etc.). Also, community involvement on this project particularly in regards to templates for scenes and dialogue would be something to incourage. Further down the development track, this product could even be used as some form of training for example customer service. There are many voice programs that are available for use.</p>
<p><strong>Skills Required </strong></p>
<p>The skills required include but are not limited to the following</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Graphics and design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing skills for scripts/templates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programming and using APIs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marketing </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licencing and intellectual properties </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web design for creating a hub for community feedback, development and ideas</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-AU"><br /> </p>
<p><strong>Outcome </strong></p>
<p>Clearly this is a simple project in terms of application but it will require coordination of a raft of specialists over a large scope. This project will not be earth shattering. It will however give entertainment thus fulfilling its purpose.</p>
