<h2><strong>Personal Information</strong></h2>
<p>Name: Jack Watt</p>
<p>Student Number: S</p>
<p>Email: s</p>
<p>I was born in Brisbane in 1989, My nationality is Australian of German, Scottish and Norwegian antecedence. I am a native English speaker. I grew up playing rugby league, tennis and basketball. To this day, I am still a massive rugby league fan. My team is the Brisbane Broncos and I watch every game, either live or on television. I also love Tattoos and I have quite a lot of work done myself with over 1/3 of my body tattooed. I also enjoy playing videogames, my favourite game is Counter Strike. I have played that game for over 20 years on and off through various iterations (1.6, Source and Global Offensive). I have a pet dog named Rex. He is a 13-month-old American Staffordshire Terrier who destroys everything in my house including shoes, couches and TV remotes. Part of the reason I commenced studies is due to losing my right index finger in an industrial accident.</p>
<h2><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h2>
<p>The base interest I have in Information Technologies is that I have always been fascinated with videogames and more broadly computers. I chose to study at RMIT because it&rsquo;s a prestigious and international recognised university. Online study is also a more convenient method of tuition because of my circumstances. My motivation in learning about information technology is primarily vocational. IT is the wave of the future and as technology develops the need for IT professionals will only increase. My thought process has been to come to RMIT to learn and develop my skills to change my career path and maximise my opportunities within this growing industry.</p>
<h2><strong>Ideal Job</strong></h2>

<p>Cyber security analysts design and implement security procedures and policies to safeguard a company&rsquo;s computer networks and systems. They screen their employer&rsquo;s networks for any breaches in security. Software and encryption is installed to protect against breaches or vulnerabilities. They also research developing IT trends and train the wider business on security matters. The analyst may even simulate a security attack to test the protocols and tailor the responses and remedies.</p>
<p>This Career appeals to me because of potential for growth not just within the industry but my personal development. The forensic aspects of a position such as this are exciting. I am under no illusions that I will be able to walk into a career such as this even after the completion of this degree although I am hoping that I may build towards it.</p>
<p>I currently possess no relevant skills or training required for this position other than a basic level of computer knowledge and some character attributes that generally appeal to potential employers (hard work, attention to detail, dedication and commitment).</p>
<p>To undertake a potential career as a cyber security analyst you need to have as per the advertisement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Demonstrated experience in security operations or technical analytics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to work in complex operational environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding of Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and Information Security Manual (ISM)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently I don&rsquo;t have any tangible well thought out ideas on how to best obtain a job like this other than completing this degree and familiarizing myself with Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and Information Security Manual (ISM). I consider myself to be taking my first baby steps on this journey into the world of IT. Hopefully through my studies at RMIT I can develop more of a concrete idea and plan to work in this field.</p>
